Nature Sounds contains a set of royalty-free nature field recordings in the following categories: Animals, Forest, Rain, Water, and Wind.

It's an excellent addition to our most popular Rain Sounds and Water Sounds libraries. The new Nature Sounds offers more sonic variety and is ideal for sound design, film, social media, and music production.

Our friends from Free To Use Sounds recorded the included sounds in Taiwan and offered them as a free download to 99Sounds visitors.

You can find more field recordings from various places around the globe on the excellent Free To Use Sounds website.

The free nature sounds are provided in 24-bit 96 kHz stereo WAV format.
