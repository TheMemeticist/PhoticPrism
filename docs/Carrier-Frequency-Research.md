### What “carrier frequency” is (and why it can matter)

For **binaural beats**, you play two steady tones—one to each ear. The **beat frequency** is the *difference* (e.g., 250 Hz left + 261 Hz right → **11 Hz** beat). The **carrier frequency** is basically the “pitch” you’re riding on (often the average of the two tones).

Research suggests carrier frequency mainly matters for **how strongly the binaural beat is perceived / encoded**, not because there’s strong evidence that one carrier magically “entrains better” for meditation outcomes:

* **Binaural beat perception weakens above ~1000 Hz carrier** (classic discussion: Oster). ([Internet Archive][1])
* Many neuro / hearing papers pick carriers **around ~400–500 Hz** because that’s a “sweet spot” for binaural-beat salience and brainstem phase-locking. ([PMC][2])
* Most binaural-beat discussions place the **beat (difference) that’s reliably perceived** in roughly **~1–30 Hz**; once you push beyond that (like 35–45 Hz), you often get weaker/less “true binaural beat” perception and should consider **amplitude-modulation / isochronic** methods instead. ([PMC][3])
* Studies have explicitly compared different carriers (e.g., 250 vs 1000 Hz) and show carrier choice can change measured responses—so it’s not “nothing”—but it’s not a solved “one best carrier per band” thing either. ([PMC][4])

### The practical takeaway (best-effort, evidence-aligned)

**Carrier frequency matters most for:**

1. **Comfort** (can you actually listen for 10–60 minutes?)
2. **Beat clarity** (how “present” the beat feels)
3. **Whether it’s still “binaural” in practice** (especially at your 35–45 Hz rows)

A good default rule set:

* **Keep carrier between ~200–600 Hz** for most meditative/movement work (comfortable + strong binaural salience). ([PMC][2])
* **Avoid carriers >1000 Hz** if your goal is “binaural beat” specifically. ([Internet Archive][1])
* For **35–45 Hz targets**, switch from binaural beats → **amplitude-modulated sound (monaural) at 35–45 Hz** (or isochronic), because that’s closer to how auditory steady-state responses are commonly driven at gamma-ish rates. ([PubMed][5])

## Suggested carrier choices for *your* schedule targets

(Using the rows you listed in **Schedule.MD**: Wake Up Opener ~6 Hz; Qigong/Tai Chi ~11 Hz; Yoga ~15 Hz; 13 Luohan/Wing Chun ~20 Hz; TKD ~24 Hz; Strength ~25 Hz; Pranayama ~35 Hz; Metta ~40 Hz; Focused Attention ~45 Hz; Foam Roller ~10 Hz; Restorative Yoga ~5 Hz.)   

### 5–6 Hz (Restorative / deep calming)

* **Your rows:** Restorative Yoga ~5 Hz , Wake Up Opener ~6 Hz 
* **Binaural carrier suggestion:** **180–300 Hz**
* Why: low-ish carriers tend to be comfortable for longer sessions; still well below the ~1000 Hz region where binaural perception wanes. ([Internet Archive][1])

### 10–11 Hz (Tai Chi / Qigong / Foam roller = “clean alpha”)

* **Your rows:** Qigong ~11 Hz , Tai Chi ~11 Hz , Foam Roller ~10 Hz 
* **Binaural carrier suggestion:** **220–500 Hz** (if you want one default: **~400 Hz**)
* Why: carriers around **400–500 Hz** are commonly used explicitly because binaural-beat perception is strong there. ([PMC][2])

### ~15 Hz (Yoga flow / “low beta”)

* **Your row:** Yoga ~15 Hz 
* **Binaural carrier suggestion:** **300–600 Hz**
* Why: still in a comfortable hearing zone; you may find slightly higher carriers “cut through” movement/breath sounds better, while staying in the region known for decent binaural salience. ([PMC][2])

### 20–25 Hz (martial arts + strength)

* **Your rows:** 13 Luohan ~20 , Wing Chun ~20 , TKD ~24 , Strength ~25 
* **Binaural carrier suggestion:** **400–800 Hz** (try **~500–600 Hz** first)
* Note: you’re approaching the upper end of where “binaural beat” as a percept is usually discussed (many sources cite ~1–30 Hz range for the beat itself). If your subjective beat “presence” gets weak here, that’s normal. ([PMC][3])

### 35–45 Hz (your pranayama / metta / focused attention rows)

* **Your rows:** Pranayama ~35 , Metta ~40 , Focused Attention ~45 
* **Strong recommendation:** switch from “binaural beats” → **amplitude modulation (monaural) / isochronic** at **35–45 Hz**

  * Example: a **500 Hz** tone (or broadband noise) **amplitude-modulated at 40 Hz** is closer to how 40 Hz auditory steady-state is commonly produced/measured. ([PubMed][5])
* If you *insist* on binaural at these rates, just know the percept may not behave like classic binaural beats (and may feel like roughness/two tones), because “beat frequency” perception is usually discussed below ~30 Hz. ([PMC][3])

## A simple “do this in your app” default map

If you want one clean setup without overthinking:

* **5–6 Hz rows:** carrier **220 Hz**
* **10–11 Hz rows:** carrier **400 Hz**
* **15 Hz rows:** carrier **500 Hz**
* **20–25 Hz rows:** carrier **600 Hz**
* **35–45 Hz rows:** **AM/isochronic** at target rate, carrier **500–1000 Hz** (or broadband)

This aligns with (a) staying under ~1000 Hz for binaural carriers ([Internet Archive][1]) and (b) using the commonly “salient” mid-carrier region when you *are* doing binaural. ([PMC][2])

## One quick experimental protocol (so you can verify with Muse + feel)

For each target row:

1. Keep **beat frequency constant** (e.g., 11 Hz)
2. Try carriers **250 vs 400 vs 700 Hz** (3–5 minutes each)
3. Record: perceived beat clarity, comfort, and your Muse metrics
   If you see no consistent difference, then **carrier doesn’t matter much for you** beyond comfort—which is a totally valid outcome (and consistent with the broader “mixed evidence” vibe in reviews). ([PMC][3])

If you tell me what your audio engine supports (pure tones only vs noise carriers vs AM/isochronic), I’ll translate the above into exact parameter presets (left Hz / right Hz, or AM settings) for every row in your Schedule.MD.
